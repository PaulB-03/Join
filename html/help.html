            Welcome to the help page for <strong>Join</strong>, your guide to using our Kanban project management tool.
            Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Join</strong> is a Kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning “billboard”, is a highly effective method to visualize work,
            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (flow). Join leverages Kanban principles to help you
            manage tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.

        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                <p>
                    When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                    contains four default lists: “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Await feedback”, and “Done”.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                <p>
                    In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the “Contacts” section,
                    click “New contact”, and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
                    assigned
                    tasks and interact with tasks on the board.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click the “+” button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details such
                    as
                    task name, description, due date, assignees, and priority.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    As a task moves from one stage to another, reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the
                    card
                    from one list to another.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the “Done” list or delete it. Deleting a card
                    will
                    permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                    irreversible.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="footer-note">
            Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure
            the board reflects the current state of your project.
        </p>
