        Welcome to the help page for
        <a href="../index.html">Join</a>, your guide to using our Kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <a href="../index.html">Join</a> is, how it can benefit you,
        and how to use it.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="../index.html">Join</a> is a Kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer
        Akademie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning “billboard”, is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (flow). <a href="../index.html">Join</a> leverages
        Kanban principles to help you manage tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        It is important to note that <a href="../index.html">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best
        possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <a href="../index.html">Join</a>.
      </div>

      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="../index.html">Join</a>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
          <p>
            When you log in to <a href="../index.html">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Await
            feedback”, and “Done”.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
          <p>
            In <a href="../index.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the “Contacts” section, click “New contact”, and fill in the required information. Once
            added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and interact with tasks on the board.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the “+” button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
            details such as task name, description, due date, assignees, and priority.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
          <p>As a task moves from one stage to another, reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the “Done” list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
            this action is irreversible.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
