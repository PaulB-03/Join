      <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>

          <strong>Other Users.</strong> When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas
          of the Services, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view
          descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile.

        (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an
        account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
        your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h2 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
        safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
        environment.
      </p>

        years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
        collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacy@policy-example.com.

      <h2 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
        review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, to
        request rectification or erasure; to restrict the processing of your personal information; if applicable, to data portability; and not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain
        circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
        section <a href="#section11">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> below.
      </p>
      <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
      <p>
        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your
        <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080">Member State data protection authority</a> or

        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
        <a href="#section11">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> below.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
        information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can contact us using the contact information provided.</p>

      <h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
        data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we
        do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
        we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>
      <h2 id="section10">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
      <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated ‘Revised’ date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this
        Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to
        be informed of how we are protecting your information.
      </p>
